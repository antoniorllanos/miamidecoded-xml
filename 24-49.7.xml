Permit issuance, confirmation of natural forest community maps, existing permits, approvals and consent agreements.<section prefix='(1)'>The Department shall deny an application, or approve an application and issue a permit (subject to conditions, limitations or restrictions), for the activity proposed under the permit application, provided:<section prefix='(a)'>The required application fee and permit fee is submitted to Miami-Dade County.</section><section prefix='(b)'>A performance bond, if required, has been posted. As a condition of issuing a tree removal permit, the Department may require the posting of a performance bond to guarantee compliance with all other conditions, limitations, and restrictions of the tree removal permit (the permitted activity), including, without limitation, planting of all required replacement trees. The bond shall be equivalent to one hundred (100) percent of the estimated cost of the permitted activity and may be in the form of a letter of credit, surety, cash, or certificate of deposit. All performance bonds shall remain in force for a minimum of either one (1) year after the actual completion date of the permitted activity (to ensure that any replanted trees which perish are replaced), or until viability of all replanted trees has been achieved, whichever occurs last. However, at the discretion of the Director or the Director's designee, performance bonds may be partially released in phases based upon partial completion of planting or other permit requirements.</section><section prefix='(c)'>All required plans or covenants are submitted and are in compliance with the standards herein.</section></section><section prefix='(2)'>All permits shall clearly specify all conditions, limitations and restrictions required by the Department. The permit applicant shall acknowledge that the permit applicant fully understands and agrees to comply with all of said conditions, limitations or restrictions by signing the permit prior to its issuance.</section><section prefix='(3)'>All tree removal permit applications which remain incomplete for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days shall be denied.
