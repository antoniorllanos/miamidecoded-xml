<text><section>Sec. 24-33. Refund of fees.<section>If a person, firm or corporation to whom a permit has been issued decides to cancel the work for which a permit fee has been collected by the Department of Environmental Resources Management, the person, firm or corporation shall be entitled to a refund. Refunds for permit fees previously collected shall be made by the Finance Department, but must be requested prior to the beginning of any work and no later than the date on which the permit expires. No refunds shall be made on permit fees of ten dollars ($10.00) or less. In lieu of a refund, a credit for the amount of the permit fee in excess of the ten dollars ($10.00) may be given to the person, firm, or corporation which may be applied to the charge for a subsequent permit of equal or greater amount.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
