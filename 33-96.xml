<text><section>Except as provided in, signs illuminated by flashing, moving, intermittent, chasing or rotating lights are prohibited. Signs may be illuminated by exposed bulbs, fluorescent tubes, interior lighting, or by indirect lighting from any external source. Indirect lighting, such as floodlights, shall not shine directly on adjacent property, motorists or pedestrians. Illumination shall be such that it will provide reasonable illumination and eliminate glare and intensity which might pose safety hazards to drivers and pedestrians. Revolving and rotating signs shall be illuminated by internal lighting only.</section></text><history>(Ord. No. 85-59, ยง 2, 7-18-85; Ord. No. 94-99, ยง 1, 5-17-94)</history></law>
