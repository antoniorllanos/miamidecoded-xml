<text><section>Sec. 2-56.29. Compensation of former employees denied adequate contributions.<section>The County Manager shall have the authority to investigate and resolve claims involving the failure to make adequate retirement contributions on behalf of former County employees. Any former employee may file a written claim with the County Manager stating the grounds upon which it is believed the County failed to make adequate retirement contributions on the former employee's behalf and the amount of such contributions the former employee believes should have been made. The Manager shall conduct an investigation of any such claim and upon completion of the investigation shall issue a written determination as to whether the claim is valid or invalid. If the Manager determines that the claim is valid, he may award to the employee such amount as the Manager deems appropriate under the circumstances and as are available in the former employee's department's existing budget. If funds in the existing budget are not available for the payment, the Manager may apply to the County Commission for the appropriation of such funds as the Manager deems necessary for adequate compensation.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
