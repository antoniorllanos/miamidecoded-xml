<text><section>Whenever a commodity in package form is advertised in any manner and the retail price of the package is stated in the advertisement, there shall be closely and conspicuously associated with such statement of price a declaration of the basic quantity of contents of the package as is required by law or regulation to appear on the package; provided that where the law or regulation requires a dual declaration of net quantity to appear on the package, only the declaration that sets forth the quantity in terms of the smaller unit of weight or measure (the declaration that is required to appear first and without parentheses on the package) need appear in the advertisement; and provided further that there shall not be included as part of the declaration required under this section such qualifying terms as "when packed," "minimum," "not less than" or any other terms of similar import, nor any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count (for example "jumbo," "giant," "full", and the like) that tends to exaggerate the amount of commodity in the package.</section></text><history>(Ord.
