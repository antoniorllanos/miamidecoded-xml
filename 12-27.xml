<text><section>Subject to the requirements of Florida Statutes Sections 100.211 and 101.161 and unless expressly waived by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the Board members present, all resolutions calling a special election to place a bond referendum before the voters must include a statement within the ballot summary which informs voters that such general obligation bonds if approved will be "paid or secured by taxes derived from the assessed value of property in the County." The required inclusion of such language in the general obligation bond referendum ballot summary is directory only and the failure to include such language shall not be used as a basis to invalidate the bond referendum or the ballot summary in any litigation.</section></text><history>(Ord.
