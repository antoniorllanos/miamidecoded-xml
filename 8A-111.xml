Whenever an advertised, posted, or labeled price per unit of weight, measure, or count includes a fraction of a cent, all elements of the fraction shall be prominently displayed and the numeral or numerals expressing the fraction shall be immediately adjacent to and of the same general design and style as, and at least one-half (½) the height and width of the numeral representing the whole cents.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
