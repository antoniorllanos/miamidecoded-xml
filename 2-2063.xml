<text><section>The Youth Commission may establish such committees, including but not limited to an executive committee, as are deemed necessary and appropriate to assist in its function and duties. The executive committee shall be comprised of the chair of the Youth Commission and the chairs of each standing committee. The executive committee shall act on behalf of the Youth Commission in the event of any emergency that does not permit calling a special meeting of the Youth Commission. Members of the committees established by the Youth Commission with the exception of the executive committee, may include nonvoting members and nonmembers of the Youth Commission. With the exception of the actions taken by the executive committee, committee actions shall not be deemed to be the action of the Youth Commission and shall in no way bind the Youth Commission or its members.</section></text><history>(Ord.
