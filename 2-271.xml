<text><section>It is the goal of Miami-Dade County to adopt the spirit underlying the principles of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (commonly referred to as "CEDAW" and hereinafter referred to as "Convention"). The Convention, a human rights treaty adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1979, aims to eliminate all discrimination against women around the world, including but not limited to in the areas of economic development, health and safety, and education. Miami-Dade County finds a need to gather data locally and provide analysis annually to study gender equity in Miami-Dade County. "Gender Equity Data" shall be defined as information collected to identify disparities existing between women and men throughout Miami-Dade County and shall include, to the extent permitted by law, information regarding sex, race, sexual orientation, immigration status, parental status, disability, and age.</section></text><history>(Ord.
