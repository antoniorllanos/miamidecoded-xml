<text><section>Sec. 33B-29. Vested rights.<section prefix='(a)'>Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, any landowner who claims a vested right to develop his property at a density greater than permitted under this division may submit an application for a determination of vested rights to the Department of Planning and Zoning during the effective period of this division.</section><section prefix='(b)'>Any person who claims a vested right shall file an application for a determination of vested rights with the Department of Planning and Zoning, and shall attach a sworn affidavit setting forth the facts upon which the applicant bases his claim for vested rights. In addition to any other submission required by the Department of Planning and Zoning, the applicant shall include copies of any contracts, letters and other documents upon which a claim of vested rights is based. The mere existence of zoning prior to the effective date of this division shall not vest rights. Grandfathered rights which preceded this division shall be extinguished.</section><section prefix='(c)'>The Department of Planning and Zoning shall review the application and determine whether the applicant has demonstrated:<section prefix='(1)'>An act of development approval by an agency of Metropolitan Miami-Dade County,</section><section prefix='(2)'>Upon which the developer has in good faith relied to his detriment,</section><section prefix='(3)'>Such that it would be highly inequitable to deny the landowner the right to complete the previously approved development.</section></section><section prefix='(d)'>Effect of vested rights determination. A determination that a landowner is entitled to a vested right to develop at a density greater than permitted under this division does not except the development from compliance with the standards set forth in Section 33B-26 of this division.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
