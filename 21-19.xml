Disposition of weapons seized on arrest.<section>It shall be the duty of every police officer, upon making any arrest and taking a weapon under any provision of this article, to deliver such weapon to the clerk of the court of appropriate jurisdiction, to be held by the clerk until the final determination of the prosecution. Upon a finding of guilt, it shall be the duty of the clerk to deliver the weapon or weapons forthwith to the Miami-Dade Police Department which shall dispose of the weapon.
