Dry cleaning and laundry price sign requirements.<section>Every cleaner shall post a clear and conspicuous sign in plain view to all customers and potential customers that shall state the price the customer is to be charged for cleaning each article of clothing and other fabric. It is unlawful to charge a price that exceeds the applicable price on the sign. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a cleaner from charging a price higher than the applicable price stated on the sign when special handling is necessary that results in an increase to the price listed, provided that the amount of and reason for the difference in price is disclosed to the customer. Cleaning provided by means of a pick-up and drop-off delivery service shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
