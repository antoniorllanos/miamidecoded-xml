<text><section>Sec. 32-52. Abandonment of facilities.<section>No public utility, as defined herein, shall abandon any facilities or withdraw any service provided for in its schedule of rates on file with the Board until it first has obtained written authorization therefor from the Board; provided, this shall not apply to the customary discontinuance of services for non-payment of bills as may be provided for in its tariffs. Before authorizing any such abandonment or withdrawal, the Board shall hold a public hearing, after due notice, for the purpose of determining the requirements of public convenience and necessity with reference thereto, and whether the same will be contrary to the public interest.</section></section></text><history>(Ord.
